# Dogs-vs.-Cats-An-Image-Classification-Task-using-TensorFlow
In this repository, I put into test my newly acquired Deep Learning skills, in order to solve the Kaggle's famous Image Classification Problem, called "Dogs vs. Cats".
Given images of dogs and cats, I try to predict if there is a dog or a cat depicted into each one of them, using Convolutional Neural Networks. My study resources for this
exercise are, firstly, the book "Deep Learning with Python" by Fran√ßois Chollet, and secondly, the DeepLearning.AI's online course "TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate", tought by Laurence Moroney.
