# Dogs vs. Cats: An Image Classification Task using TensorFlow

In this repository, I put into test my newly acquired Deep Learning skills, in order to solve the Kaggle's famous Image Classification Problem, called "Dogs vs. Cats". Given images of dogs and cats, I try to predict if there is a dog or a cat depicted into each one of them, using Convolutional Neural Networks. More specifically, the following Deep Learning techniques will be examined and used in this project: (a) Binary and (b) Multi-class Image Classification, (c) Data Augmentation, and (d) Transfer Learning. Lastly, The main programming tool for deploying this project is the Python's high-level neural network library Keras, which runs on top of TensorFlow.
