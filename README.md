# Dogs vs. Cats: An Image Classification Task using TensorFlow

In this repository, I put into test my newly acquired Deep Learning skills, in order to solve the Kaggle's famous Image Classification Problem, called "Dogs vs. Cats". Given images of dogs and cats, I try to predict if there is a dog or a cat depicted into each one of them, using Convolutional Neural Networks. The main programming tool for deploying this project is the Python's high-level neural network library Keras, which runs on top of TensorFlow. More specifically, the following Deep Learning techniques will be examined and used in this project: (a) Binary and (b) Multi-class Image Classification, (c) Data Augmentation, and (d) Transfer Learning.

My study resources for this exercise are, firstly, the book "Deep Learning with Python" by Fran√ßois Chollet, and secondly, the DeepLearning.AI's online course "TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate", tought by Laurence Moroney. The theoretical knowledge and understanding, regarding Deep Learning for Computer Vision, has been mostly available to me through  thorough self-study, and thanks to DeepLearning.AI's online course, taught by Andrew Ng, called "Deep Learning Specialization".
